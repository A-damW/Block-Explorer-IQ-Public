For any dispute with&nbsp;Everipedia, you agree to first&nbsp;contact us&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:webmaster@everipedia.com">webmaster@everipedia.com</a>&nbsp;and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that&nbsp;Everipedia&nbsp;has not&nbsp;been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), by binding arbitration by JAMS, Inc. ("JAMS"), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS contact and general information may be found at <a href="https://everipedia.org/JAMS_(alternative_dispute_resolution)">the JAMS ADR page</a>. The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles, California, unless you and&nbsp;Everipedia&nbsp;agree otherwise. If you are&nbsp;using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing&nbsp;Everipedia&nbsp;from seeking injunctive&nbsp;or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of&nbsp;Everipedia's&nbsp;proprietary interests.</p>
